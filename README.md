## Description

This software package is an open-source registry for synthetic biology glyphs. Users are able to search for glyphs given a keyword for the glyph type e.g promoter. Our vision behind this project is to provide an intuitive application with standardized glyphs. 

## Installation Instructions

Users are required to have Python 3.0 installed which is located here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Run Instructions

First, users are required to clone or download the project. Once they have acquired a version of the project, they will need to open an instance of a server. To do that, they will need to open python and enter in the following command in the terminal: "python3 -m http.server 8080". Then, users will need to navigate to the downloaded project and open the file 'index.html' with a web browser (recommended Google Chrome). Once the web browser is started, in the search bar, users will be to type 'localhost 8080'.

You have now accessed GlyphViz! Please search away!

## License Agreement

All code contributed to this project is available to the public. 

## Future Work

Similar to other open-source initives, such as Synbiohub, we would like to extend our functionality for users to interactively work with the glyphs. These features will include uploading, downloading, and rating glyphs. Additionally, we would like to allow users to create and log their submissions with GlyphViz. 

Our rating scale is from 0 to 5 stars. For users to rate the glyph, they simply need to hover above each glyph and click on the number of stars they would like to rate the glyph. This information is taken and the glyph's rating is updated and the number of votes and the current rating will show. 

For users to upload, they will be required to create an account. They can choose to make an uploaded design 'private' or 'public'. However, for any glyph that is made public, author tags are associated with the glyph to show the source of the glyph. Additionally, in order for other users to determine credibility of an uploaded glyph, they can navigate to a user's account and view the ratings on previously uploaded glyphs by that author.

For downloading, we would like to provide multiple formats for the user including jpeg, png, svg, etc...

Ideally, GlyphViz will be available as a web application at this source: https://bdathlon.github.io/2017-Rm4120-1/.
